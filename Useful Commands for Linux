Setting up a non-root user:
  sudo adduser <username> 
  sudo usermod -aG sudo <username> 
* -a: This option appends the user to the specified group without removing them from any other groups.
* -G: This option indicates that the following argument is the group to which the user will be added.

Configure the sources list: 
  sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.bak
  sudo echo "deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib" > /etc/apt/sources.list
  sudo apt update

-- The sequence of these commands is:
    1. First, a backup of the original sources.list file is created.
    2. Then, the sources.list file is modified to include the Kali Linux repository.
    3. Finally, the package lists are updated to reflect the changes made to the sources.list file.
